# React + Apollo

## Technologies

### Frontend

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- [Apollo Client 2.1](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) - Production ready, caching GrapQL client

### Backend

- `graphql-yoga` - Fully-featured GraphQL Server
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Open-sourced GraphQL API layer that turns your database into a GraphQL API

---

## Why GraphQL Client?

The major benefit of using a GraphQL client library is that it saves you from writing infrastructure code for networking and caching.

## Apollo vs Relay

[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) is open-source built by Facebook. Despite its performance benefits, its a pretty complex framework and understanding all its bits and pieces does require some time to really get into it. The release of [Relay Modern](http://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/introduction-to-relay.html) is to simplify all that, however as _"they"_ suggested, Relay might not be the right choice yet if you're _just gettting started_ with GraphQL.

[Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) is a community-driven effort to build an easy-to-understand, flexible and powerful GraphQL client. It's production-ready and has handy feature like caching, optimistic UI, subscription support and many more.
